###Week 3
I'm trying to visualize the state population data set I got from the US Census Bureau. I was using both Jquery and P5 libararies. My intent is to click the check so the canvas is going to draw 50 circles of different sizes according to the population of each state. The size of the cicles is determined by the map function that maps the population to the radius of the circle. 
I successfully got the data set as an array of arrays of JSON objects in the console. But I had trouble extracting the data through the chain method. 

###Week 4
My circuit worked fine before I added the button. I'm trying to fix the problme but couldn't. i think my setup is right.
